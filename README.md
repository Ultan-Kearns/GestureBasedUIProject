# Gesture Based UI Project by Ultan Kearns & Paul Kenny

Produced for Gesture Based UI module in 4th year, (Honours) Software Development, Galway-Mayo Institute Of Technology.
Lecturer: Damien Costello

## Premise

This project is based on the popular game [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) which has the player memorise a series of colours creating a pattern which the player must re-enter. This is a gesture based project and will utilise voice recognition.

## Technical Information

This program was produced using Python and the graphics library [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) and Python's speech recognition library (SpeechRecognition).  This application requires an internet connection as it utilizes Google Speech API.

## Why Python

Python is a great programming language which has lots of libraries which can be utilised to create a fully functional gesture based user interface that will feel intuitive to the user.

## Running

To run this program you just run the simple command app.py in the project directory.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Ultan-Kearns/GestureBasedUIProject
> cd GestureBasedUIProject
> python3 app.py
```
